.SYNOPSIS
  Generate a self-signed "Root CA" and an end-entity user certificate
  for mTLS authentication, using only built-in Windows PowerShell commands.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script:
    1. Prompts for Organization Name and Username.
    2. Generates a self-signed root CA certificate in the current user's store.
    3. Generates a user (child) certificate, signed by that CA.
    4. Exports:
        - Root CA cert as <username>-ca.crt
        - User cert (public key) as <username>.cer and <username>.pem
        - PKCS#12 file <username>.p12 containing the user cert + private key
          (password-protected).
    5. Places all exported files into a directory under your user profile:
         %UserProfile%\sslpair
